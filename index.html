		<h3>INTRO....</h3>
		<article class="intro">
			<p>Hello! <strong>I am Bamigbopa Ganiyu Babatunde, A.K.A gharnie baba.</strong> I was born in some years after christ.</p>
			<p>Growing up poor made me realize how trusting God and hardworking help at all things. so, I made a decision that i was not gonna go directly to tertiary instituition but instead acquire at less a skill and apply for job to raise some funds. Despite bthe challenges, i was able to stand strong with the help of Holy spirit, some people, friends,colleagues, and families. I used to be very independent to the extent that i barely ask my parents for things. this actually got me "grinding".</p>

		<h3>ABOUTS</h3>
		<article class="abouts">
			<p>However, i have things that i like and things that get me pissed, Like getting angry real quick but doesn't last long due to frustrations, lack, and negative actoims towards me.  I can be so emotional at times, that i cry over the things that make me sad. But I thank God that i'm totally change because I've received the HOLY SPIRIT. I love to be shown love and also show love to people. Despite your actions towards me, i will still act with all sincerity cos i believe some people act over their current situations at times. You wanna k now my best meal? Okay, I'll tell you. it is bread and egg though it was initially yam and egg but i reduced the love i had for yam at age 9.</p>
			<p>I strongly believe you spend time more with what or who you love. I belive those who take their time to reach out to me are my lovers but those that don't i can tell through their actions. I really love music and cool movies like love movies.</p>
